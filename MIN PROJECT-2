Explanation:
Normalization: Convert both names to the same case to ignore case sensitivity.

Removing Common Characters: This step attempts to cancel out characters that are shared between both names, leaving only the unique characters to be counted.

Count Calculation: The number of remaining characters is used to determine how many times to "rotate" through the FLAMES list.

FLAMES List Rotation: The list is rotated based on the remaining character count until only one character is left, which corresponds to the relationship status.

Result Mapping: The final character in the FLAMES list is mapped to the relationship status and returned as the result.
